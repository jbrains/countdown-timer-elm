# jbrains learns some Elm

I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm trying.

This is a countdown timer that I'll eventually be able to use in my training courses. 
I've built this before in Javascript, so I'm trying to build it again in Elm.

## Please Help!

I don't know what I'm doing! I need your help. I especially want these things:

- Make illegal states unrepresentable.
- Learn idioms.
- Learn useful libraries.

Please submit pull requests or add comments. Optionally, [ping me on Twitter](//twitter.com/jbrains) to tell
me something. Send me articles to read. Thank you!

## Build and Run

I use [gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to build the Elm application and run it with an embedded web server. Do these things once:

These instructions seem accurate for Node 6.x and Gulp 4.x. Please update this statement if you know that these instructions work for more versions of these packages.

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Use Node to install gulp: `$ npm install --global gulp-cli`.

To run the web server:

1. Run gulp, which by default starts the web server, builds the Elm code, then watches the Elm code files to rebuild the files whenever they change. `$ gulp`

Visit <https://localhost:4001> to see the running application.

To run the tests:

1. `$ elm-test`.
